# Hovera Pitch Deck - Speaker Notes

## Slide 1: Build Robots with Just Prompts

Jensen Huang says the next big thing is Physical AI—AI with a body. That body is a robot.

Hovera makes building robots as easy as software. Describe what you want, and we handle the complexity—no CAD headaches or wiring guesswork. From idea to machine in minutes.

## Slide 2: Robotics Is Still Too Hard

AI is ready for the physical world, but robotics tooling is stuck in the past. Today, building a simple robot requires five different fragmented tools. This friction kills ideas before they ever touch hardware. Hovera exists to close that gap.

---

## Slide 3: One Prompt. Complete Robot.

One prompt, one workflow. Hovera generates the logic, code, wiring, 3D design, simulation, and BOM. We turn intent into a complete, buildable system instantly.

---

## Slide 4: How it works

Hovera is an intent-driven pipeline. Describe the goal, generate the system, and validate it in simulation. This ensures builders are ready to run their designs on real hardware. It doesn't replace engineers; it removes the tech friction.

Watch as one prompt generates everything: the logic flowchart, wiring diagram, production code, design, and simulation. This automated workflow replaces days of manual engineering.

## Slide 5: Focused Early Users

“We start with a focused market.
Engineering students and makers.

Why?
They have tight deadlines, real projects, and limited budgets. They actively share tools with each other.

This is the perfect early user group to test fast before moving to labs, startups, and schools.”

---

## Slide 6: Why Hovera Is Different

We don't just write code; we build robots. Hovera is hardware-aware and end-to-end. Our moat is our data: as Hovera learns from every validated system, it becomes harder for anyone to replicate.

---

## Slide 7: Built for Adoption First, Scale Later

“Hovera uses a free and paid model.

Users start free, then pay as they build harder robots.
Students join first, then labs and teams scale up later.

As people build more robots, our business grows with them.”

---

## Slide 8: Why Existing Tools Fall Short

Existing tools like Cursor or Arduino only solve pieces of the puzzle. None connect the entire workflow from intent to hardware. That end-to-end connection is the gap Hovera fills.

---

## Slide 9: Where We Are

“Hovera is already in private beta.

Early users are generating complete robot systems using the full pipeline — from prompt, to testing, and validation in simulation.

The core system is live and getting better every day.”

---

## Slide 10: Founder

I'm Eki Bagas. I'm building Hovera because I personally lived the pain of the broken way we build robots. I’m building the tool I wish I had.

---

## Slide 11: Vision

“Our long-term vision is simple:

Build robots as easily as software.”

“Hovera lowers the barrier between ideas and real machines.

We’re looking for feedback, pilot users, and early supporters to help shape the future of robotics.

Build robots as easily as software.”
